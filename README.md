## Analyzing Performance of Videos on Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels
## Hypothesis

### Null hypothesis (H0)
There won’t be a significant difference in the performance of the videos on Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels. 

### Alternative hypothesis (H1)
I hypothesized there will be a significant difference in the performance of the videos on Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels, where the videos are performing better on Instagram Reels than they are on Youtube Shorts. 


## Results and Discussion

### The hypothesis
Spearman’s rank correlation was used to determine the correlation between the views of the videos on Instagram Reels and on Youtube Shorts. It is known that a p-value higher than 0.05 indicates that there's a high likelihood of the correlation being produced by chance.
