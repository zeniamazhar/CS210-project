<h1>Welcome to the project I made for my data science course at Sabanci University! âœ¨</h1> 
My aim with this project was to collect data from <strong>Youtube shorts</strong> and <strong>Instagram reels</strong> by using the relevant APIs, and compared them by statistically analysing this data.
<br><br>
The channel I used on both platforms was my own, where I posted shorts and reels about art/sketches I made. The videos I posted on both platforms were the exact same, except the music used in some cases wasn't always the same.
<br><br>
This included obtaining the data from Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels by using Youtube API V3 and Instaloader, respectively. Afterwards, I cleaned the data and analysed the relationship between the number of hashtags, the likes, and the views each of the videos got on both platforms, as well as some combinations of two or more of these metrics, to see which platform the videos were performing better on.
