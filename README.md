# CS 210 Project
## Analyzing Performance of Videos on Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels

## Introduction
I make art as a hobby, and I post short videos about it on Instagram Reels and Youtube Shorts. The videos I analyzed in this project are exactly the same on both platforms, just with different captions/titles and different music according to what is trending on the site. My main objective was to understand which platform the videos do better on, or if they are performing ina similar manner on both platforms.

## Hypothesis

### Null hypothesis (H0)
There won’t be a significant difference in the performance of the videos on Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels. 

### Alternative hypothesis (H1)
I hypothesized there will be a significant difference in the performance of the videos on Youtube Shorts and Instagram Reels, where the videos are performing better on Instagram Reels than they are on Youtube Shorts. 


## Results and Discussion

### The hypothesis
Spearman’s rank correlation was used to determine the correlation between the views of the videos on Instagram Reels and on Youtube Shorts. It is known that a p-value higher than 0.05 indicates that there's a high likelihood of the correlation being produced by chance.
